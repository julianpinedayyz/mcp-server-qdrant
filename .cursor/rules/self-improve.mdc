## Environment Management
- When `uv.lock` or `pyproject.toml [tool.uv]` exists, use `uv` for package management (e.g., `uv pip install`, `uv venv`).
- **Crucially:** If the shell context might be reset (e.g., new terminal, between separate `run_terminal_cmd` calls), **prefix each command** requiring the virtual environment with the activation command (e.g., `source .venv/bin/activate && uv pip install ...`, `source .venv/bin/activate && python -m ...`). Simple activation once per session may not be sufficient if the shell state is not persistent between tool calls.
- Check for potential conflicts between system-installed tools (e.g., Homebrew Python/uvicorn) and virtual environment versions (`which uvicorn`, `which python`). Ensure commands execute using the intended versions from the activated `.venv`.

## Debugging Execution Issues
- For silent script/server exits:
    1. Verify command-line arguments (e.g., `--transport sse` for web servers).
    2. Increase log verbosity (`--log-level debug`).
    3. Check for missing dependencies (`ModuleNotFoundError`), including transitive ones (consider explicit installation).
    4. If logs are missing, add temporary `print()` statements early in initialization (e.g., lifespan managers) to trace execution flow.
    5. Attempt execution via different runners (`python -m main` vs. `uvicorn app:mcp`) to check for runner-specific issues or different error reporting.
    6. Isolate the problem: Test core components (e.g., basic FastAPI app with `uvicorn`) to confirm the environment and tools are fundamentally working.
    7. If issues persist, consider environment corruption: Deactivate, remove (`rm -rf .venv`), recreate (`uv venv`), reactivate, reinstall dependencies.

## Verification
- Prioritize verifying complex changes (e.g., after rebasing, merging logic) with local execution and tests before documenting or pushing, if the local environment allows.
- If local testing is blocked by persistent environment issues, clearly communicate this and adapt the verification strategy (e.g., testing in a different environment post-push).

## Git Workflow
- **Git Divergence:** Handle branch divergence carefully. `git rebase --abort` means remote changes were *not* integrated. Merging (e.g., `git merge origin/master` into local branch) is an alternative integration strategy. Resolve conflicts, often preferring local changes (`--ours` when merging into the checked-out branch) if `local-changes` branch holds the intended state.
- **Git Branch Cleanup:** Consolidate work from messy/temporary branches into a clean `dev` branch via merges (e.g., `git checkout -b dev master && git merge <branch_to_merge>`) as a recovery method. Delete temporary local branches afterwards (`git branch -d <branch_name>`).
- **Useful Git Commands:** Use `git cherry -v <upstream_branch> <local_branch>` to see unique local commits. Use `git reset --hard <remote>/<branch>` to force-match remote (use cautiously as it discards local commits). Use `git show <commit>:<path>` to view file content at a specific commit.

## Cursor Integration
- **Cursor Rule Frontmatter:** Ensure YAML frontmatter keys like `description` and `globs` have explicit empty values (`""`, `[]`) if applicable, otherwise Cursor might not parse the rule correctly and it may appear blank in the UI.

## Tool Usage
- **Tool `edit_file`:** If `edit_file` fails repeatedly, especially when modifying YAML frontmatter, consider manual edits as a reliable fallback.
